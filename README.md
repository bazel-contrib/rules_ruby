# Ruby Rules for Bazel

## Overview

This repository hosts [Ruby][1] language ruleset for [Bazel][2].

The ruleset is known to work with:

- Bazel 6 using WORKSPACE and Bzlmod *(tested on CI)*;
- Bazel 5 using WORKSPACE *(no longer tested on CI)*.

## Getting Started

### WORKSPACE

1. Install the ruleset following WORKSPACE instructions on the [latest release][13].
2. Download and install Ruby:

```bazel
# WORKSPACE
load("@rules_ruby//ruby:deps.bzl", "rb_register_toolchains")

rb_register_toolchains(
    version = "3.0.6",
    # alternatively, load version from .ruby-version file
    # version_file = "//:.ruby-version",
)
```

3. *(Optional)* Download and install Bundler dependencies:

```bazel
# WORKSPACE
load("@rules_ruby//ruby:deps.bzl", "rb_bundle")

rb_bundle(
    name = "bundle",
    srcs = ["//:Gemfile.lock"],
    gemfile = "//:Gemfile",
)
```

4. Start defining your library, binary and test targets in `BUILD` files.

### Bzlmod

1. Install ruleset following Bzlmod instructions on the [latest release][13].
2. Download and install Ruby:

```bazel
# MODULE.bazel
ruby = use_extension("@rules_ruby//ruby:extensions.bzl", "ruby")
ruby.toolchain(
    name = "ruby",
    version = "3.0.6",
    # alternatively, load version from .ruby-version file
    # version_file = "//:.ruby-version",
)
use_repo(ruby, "ruby")
```

3. _(Optional)_ Download and install Bundler dependencies:

```bazel
# MODULE.bazel
ruby.bundle(
    name = "bundle",
    srcs = ["//:Gemfile.lock"],
    gemfile = "//:Gemfile",
    toolchain = "@ruby//:BUILD",
)
use_repo(ruby, "bundle", "ruby_toolchains")
```

4. Register Ruby toolchains:

```bazel
# MODULE.bazel
register_toolchains("@ruby_toolchains//:all")
```

4. Start defining your library, binary and test targets in `BUILD` files.

## Documentation

- See [repository rules][3] for the documentation of `WORKSPACE` rules.
- See [rules][4] for the documentation of `BUILD` rules.

## Examples

See [`examples`][14] directory for a comprehensive set of examples how to use the ruleset.

## Toolchains

The following toolchains are known to work and tested on CI.

| Ruby              | Linux | macOS | Windows |
|-------------------|-------|-------|---------|
| MRI 3.3 (preview) | 游릴    | 游릴    | 游린      |
| MRI 3.2           | 游릴    | 游릴    | 游릴      |
| MRI 3.1           | 游릴    | 游릴    | 游릴      |
| MRI 3.0           | 游릴    | 游릴    | 游릴      |
| JRuby 9.4         | 游릴    | 游릴    | 游릴      |
| TruffleRuby 23.0  | 游릴    | 游릴    | 游린      |

The following toolchains were previously known to work but *no longer tested on CI*.

| Ruby             | Linux | macOS | Windows |
|------------------|-------|-------|---------|
| MRI 2.7          | 游릴    | 游릴    | 游릴      |
| JRuby 9.3        | 游릴    | 游릴    | 游릴      |
| TruffleRuby 22.0 | 游릴    | 游릴    | 游린      |

### MRI

On Linux and macOS, [ruby-build][5] is used to install MRI from sources.
Keep in mind, that it takes some time for compilation to complete.

On Windows, [RubyInstaller][6] is used to install MRI.

### JRuby

On all operating systems, JRuby is downloaded manually.
It uses Bazel runtime Java toolchain as JDK.

### TruffleRuby

On Linux and macOS, [ruby-build][5] is used to install TruffleRuby.
Windows is not supported.

### Other

On Linux and macOS, you can potentially use any Ruby distribution that is supported by [ruby-build][5].
However, some are known not to work or work only partially (e.g. mRuby has no bundler support).

## Known Issues

* JRuby/TruffleRuby might need `HOME` variable exposed.
  See [`eamples/gem/.bazelrc`][7] to learn how to do that.
  This is to be fixed in [`jruby/jruby#5661`][9] and [`oracle/truffleruby#2784`][10].
* JRuby might fail with `Errno::EACCES: Permission denied - NUL` error on Windows.
  You need to configure JDK to allow proper access.
  See [`examples/gem/.bazelrc`][7] to learn how to do that.
  This is described in [`jruby/jruby#7182`][11].
* RuboCop < 1.55 crashes with `LoadError` on Windows.
  This is fixed in [`rubocop/rubocop#12062`][12].
* REPL doesn't work when used with `bazel test`.
  To work it around, use a debugger with remote client support such as [`ruby/debug`][8] .
  See [`examples/gem/.bazelrc`][7] to learn how to do that.
