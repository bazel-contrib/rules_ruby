# Do not upload locally executed action results to the remote cache.
# This should be the default for local builds so local builds cannot poison the remote cache.
# It should be flipped to `--remote_upload_local_results` on CI
# by using `--bazelrc=.aspect/bazelrc/ci.bazelrc`.

# Don't allow network access for build actions in the sandbox.
# Ensures that you don't accidentally make non-hermetic actions/tests which depend on remote
# services.
# Developers should tag targets with `tags=["requires-network"]` to opt-out of the enforcement.

# Warn if a test's timeout is significantly longer than the test's actual execution time.
# Bazel's default for test_timeout is medium (5 min), but most tests should instead be short (1 min).
# While a test's timeout should be set such that it is not flaky, a test that has a highly
# over-generous timeout can hide real problems that crop up unexpectedly.
# For instance, a test that normally executes in a minute or two should not have a timeout of
# ETERNAL or LONG as these are much, much too generous.

# Allow the Bazel server to check directory sources for changes. Ensures that the Bazel server
# notices when a directory changes, if you have a directory listed in the srcs of some target.
# Recommended when using
# [copy_directory](https://github.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib/blob/main/docs/copy_directory.md) and
# [rules_js](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js) since npm package are source directories
# inputs to copy_directory actions.

# Use a static value for `PATH` and does not inherit `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Doesn't let environment
# variables like `PATH` sneak into the build, which can cause massive cache misses when they change.
# Use `--action_env=ENV_VARIABLE` if you want to inherit specific environment variables from the
# client, but note that doing so can prevent cross-user caching if a shared cache is used.

# Propagate tags from a target declaration to the actions' execution requirements.
# Ensures that tags applied in your BUILD file, like `tags=["no-remote"]`
# get propagated to actions created by the rule.
# Without this option, you rely on rules authors to manually check the tags you passed
# and apply relevant ones to the actions they create.

# Do not automatically create `__init__.py` files in the runfiles of Python targets. Fixes the wrong
# default that comes from Google's internal monorepo by using `__init__.py` to delimit a Python
# package. Precisely, when a `py_binary` or `py_test` target has `legacy_create_init` set to `auto (the
# default), it is treated as false if and only if this flag is set. See

# Bazel picks up host-OS-specific config lines from bazelrc files. For example, if the host OS is

# Some actions are always IO-intensive but require little compute. It's wasteful to put the output

# For actions like PackageTar it's usually faster to just re-run the work locally every time.
# You'll have to look at an execution log to figure out what other action mnemonics you care about.
